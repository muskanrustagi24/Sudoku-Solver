# Sudoku-Solver

# Objective : To make a N x N Sudoku Solver.
Pre-requisite Knowledge : Recursion and Backtracking Algorithm.

# Theory :
In this project, I'm going to implement a C++ program which solves Sudoku puzzles for us. 
Below is brief description of Sudoku and its rules:

Sudoku is a logic puzzle. The objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits in such a way that each column, each row, and each of the nine
3×3 grids that make up the larger 9×9 grid contains all of the digits from 1 to 9 exactly once.Each Sudoku puzzle begins with some cells filled in. These numbers
are chosen such that there is a unique solution to the Sudoku.
